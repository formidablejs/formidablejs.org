When you're ready to deploy your Formidable application to production, there are some important things you can do to make sure your application is running as efficiently as possible. In this document, we'll cover some great starting points for making sure your Formidable application is deployed properly.

## Server Requirements

The Formidable framework has a few system requirements. You should ensure that your web server has the following minimum Node version:

* `Node >=16.*`
* `npm/pnpm/yarn/bun`

## Deploy

### Heroku (recommended)

Formidable is Heroku-ready out of the box. Here are some few things you may need to do to get started:

Create a `Procfile` in the root of your application with the following content:

```bash title="Procfile"
web: npm start
cron: node craftsman schedule:run
```

If your application is making use of the queue system, you can add the following line to your `Procfile`:

```bash title="Procfile"
worker: node craftsman queue:work
```

:::info

Don't forget to add production `.env` details to Heroku. Remember to set `APP_DEBUG` to `false`.

:::

That's all you need to do to get started.

### Nginx

If you need more control over your server and application, we recommend deploying to a Linux server and using Nginx and PM2.

Before getting started, make sure the following prerequisites are met:
* [Node >=16.*](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (we recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))
* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) or [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
* [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)
* [Nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/)

#### Serving Your Application

Now that you have all the dependencies, you can go ahead and create a `ecosystem.config.js` file in the root of your application:

```js title="ecosystem.config.js"
module.exports = {
	apps: [
		{
			name: "web",
			script: "npm run start",
			time: true,
			error_file: "./storage/logs/web/error.log",
			out_file: "./storage/logs/web/log.log"
		},
		{
			name: "cron",
			script: "node craftsman schedule:run --no-ansi",
			max_memory_restart: "100M",
			time: true,
			error_file: "./storage/logs/cron/error.log",
			out_file: "./storage/logs/cron/log.log"
		}
	]
}
```

And finally, start your application:

```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

By default, this will start our application on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, we can change port in the `server` file:

```js title="server" {4}
Server
	.use(require('./.formidable/build').default)
	.start({
		port: 3000,
		host: 'localhost'
	})
```

:::info

We also recommend you enable PM2 to auto start your application on system boot. You can do this by running the command: `pm2 startup`

:::

#### Creating a Reverse Proxy

Now that you have started your application you can go ahead and create a virtual host:

```conf title="/etc/nginx/sites-available/app.conf"
server {
    listen 80;
	server_name _;

	location / {
		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
		proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
		proxy_http_version 1.0;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
	}
}
```
Once thats done, we can check for any issues on our newly created `app.conf`:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If everything is fine, we should see a "success" message. Then we can enable our application by creating a symbolic link of the `app.conf` file from the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/app.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Now, for changes to reflect, you will need to restart Nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

And now you should be able to access your application ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

#### Automating things

Its not always practical to ssh into your server to pull your latest changes. Because of this, we may wish to automate things a bit using Bash scripts.

Here's a simple bash script that pulls the latest changes from a repo and run the necessary commands:

<Tabs
    defaultValue={State.manager}
	groupId="package-manager"
    values={[
        {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
        {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'},
        {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
        {label: 'bun', value: 'bun'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash title="/root/deploy.sh"
echo "Jump to application folder"
cd /root/app

echo "Update application from Git"
git pull

echo "Install application dependencies"
npm install

echo "Build application"
npm run build

echo "Put application in maintenance mode"
node craftsman down

echo "Run database migrations"
node craftsman migrate:latest --no-interaction

echo "Restart application"
pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js

echo "Put application back online"
node craftsman up
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash title="/root/deploy.sh"
echo "Jump to application folder"
cd /root/app

echo "Update application from Git"
git pull

echo "Install application dependencies"
pnpm install

echo "Build application"
pnpm run build

echo "Put application in maintenance mode"
node craftsman down

echo "Run database migrations"
node craftsman migrate:latest --no-interaction

echo "Restart application"
pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js

echo "Put application back online"
node craftsman up
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash title="/root/deploy.sh"
echo "Jump to application folder"
cd /root/app

echo "Update application from Git"
git pull

echo "Install application dependencies"
yarn install

echo "Build application"
yarn run build

echo "Put application in maintenance mode"
node craftsman down

echo "Run database migrations"
node craftsman migrate:latest --no-interaction

echo "Restart application"
pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js

echo "Put application back online"
node craftsman up
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bun">

```bash title="/root/deploy.sh"
echo "Jump to application folder"
cd /root/app

echo "Update application from Git"
git pull

echo "Install application dependencies"
bun install

echo "Build application"
bun run build

echo "Put application in maintenance mode"
node craftsman down

echo "Run database migrations"
node craftsman migrate:latest --no-interaction

echo "Restart application"
pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js

echo "Put application back online"
node craftsman up
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This script can be triggered by a Github Action, for example. When we push to our `main` branch, we can have a Github Workflow that ssh's into our server on our behalf and executes the `deploy.sh` script:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/deploy.yaml"
name: Deploying

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: executing remote ssh commands using ssh key
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
          script: sh /root/deploy.sh
```

:::info

This is only an example. You don't have to use Github to be able to Automate your deployments. The same can also be achieved with Gitlab and Bitbucket Pipelines.

### Docker

You can also use Docker to deploy your application. Here's a simple `Dockerfile` that you can use to build your application:

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM node:18-alpine

# Create app directory
RUN mkdir -p /usr/app
WORKDIR /usr/app

# Install app dependencies
COPY package.json /usr/app/
RUN npm install

# Bundle app source
COPY . /usr/app
RUN npm run build
COPY . /usr/app

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

:::info

Set `APP_DEBUG` to false in your `.env` file before building your application for production.
