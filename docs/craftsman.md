# Craftsman Console

Craftsman is the command line interface included with Formidable. Craftsman is installed as a global package and on every Formidable application. It provides a number of helpful commands that can assist you while you build your application. To view a list of all available Craftsman commands, you may call the `craftsman` command:

```bash

Every command also includes a "help" screen which displays and describes the command's available arguments and options. To view a help screen, precede the name of the command with the `--help` flag:

```bash

```
